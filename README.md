# simple-screen-dim
GNOME Shell extension dim screens on laptops and desktops alike. Just click the sun icon and adjust your display brightness with up to 6 levels of brightness.

This repository was inspired by Orschiro's adjust-brightness-icon. 

Features to come:

  - Add settings section to adjust levels of brightness.
  - Make it so that a right mouse click resets brightness.
  - In multi-monitor setups, enable selection of individual monitors to dim.
  - Maybe add support for native hardware dimming control in laptops?? Maybe?? (Useful in cases where the keyboard buttons don't work)

To install simply clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SergioSahid/simple-screen-dim.git
cd simple-screen-dim
```
Make install.sh executable and run it:
```
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
Extension should be activated now. If not, try rebooting or logging out.
